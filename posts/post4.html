        This was my first week at Tafe in the virtual classroom environment. It has been a slow start but generally enjoyable nonetheless.

        We spent each class being introduced to the teachers & learning a bit about each other, while getting familiar with navigating the TDC (Tafe Digital Campus).

        All the teachers seem nice & very knowledgable in their fields which makes me excited to really get into it & learn as much as I can.

        <b>Monday</b> is a shared class with the Programming students where we cover crossover ICT units such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Apply advanced critical thinking skills to work processes</li>
            <li>Identify & evaluate emerging technologies & practices</li>
            <li>Identify & resolve client ICT problems</li>
            <li>Contribute to cyber security risk management</li>
            <li>Work collaboratively in the ICT industry</li>
            <li>Comply with IP, ethics & privacy policies in ICT environments</li>
        </ul>
        These are all essential topics to provide us with an understanding of how to operate professionally within an ICT environment.

        I'm excited to work through these modules & am confident I will gain a thorough understanding of each topic.

        <b>Tuesday</b> is a Web Dev focused class where we will cover units such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Create a markup language document</li>
            <li>Create & style simple markup language documents</li>
            <li>Create responsive web layouts</li>
            <li>Confirm accessibility of websites</li>
            <li>Create basic databases</li>
            <li>Apply a structured query language in relational databases</li>
            <li>Produce server side script for dynamic web pages</li>
        </ul>
        These are the topics I'm really excited about! I can't wait to start working through these modules so I can begin to apply

        the knowledge to my personal projects! This is exactly why I enrolled in this course.
    </p>
    <br/> 
    <p>
        The teacher for these modules, Steve Graham,

        is a really talented & knowledgeable dev & I'm excited & honoured to be able to learn from him. Steve gave the class a
        
        sneak peak at one of his personal sites & it was glorious!
    </p>

        <b>Wednesday</b> classes consist of 3 units:
        <ul>
            <li>Transfer content to websites</li>
            <li>Evaluate & select a web hosting service</li>
            <li>Produce basic client-side script</li>
        </ul>
        These units provide us with knowledge of the essential industry tools & services used to manage the structure, hosting,
        
        deployment & maintenance of web projects. Most importantly the secure storage & transfer of sensitive data.
    </p>   
    <br/>
    <p>
        To my surprise, the teacher for these units is a skateboarding & 90s punk obsessed lady named Shanna Roper. Shanna is absolutely
            
        lovely & as we share 2 deep passions, skateboarding & music, I am so excited for her classes & to be able to learn from her
            
        years of experience in Web Dev.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>    
        Skateboarding & music have been the 2 main focuses for most of my life & as I shift my focus to acquiring
            
        new skills in this field I am so extremely greatful to have the opportunity to connect with & learn from Shanna!
            
        She even has a shared Spotify playlist for the class that we can all contribute to. Naturally, I obliged & added a
            
        handful of tracks I have been listening to recently & another handful of old favourites.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Thursday</b> class is comprised of more exciting units such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Apply introductory programming techniques</li>
            <li>Implement content management systems</li>
            <li>Design website layouts</li>
            <li>Implement search engine optimisations</li>
        </ul>
        The information contained within these units will ensure we are familiar with & comfortable implementing industry standard practices

        when designing processes & writing code.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        The teacher for these units, Shaun Stummer, is extremely knowledgeable & has a wealth of experience working with a variety of
            
        programming languages. I really appreciate his teaching style & approach, which encourages us to jump in, play with the code,
            
        make mistakes & learn from the experience of practical exercises. We have started with a focus on Python fundamentals.
    </p>

    <p>
        On Saturday, while doing some Python revision, I was feeling confident so I jumped straight into the first knowledge assessment quiz
        
        for Thursday's unit "Apply introductory programming techniques".    
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p> 
        As I have about 6 months of experience working with Python from the

        Fintech bootcamp which I completed in 2023, I consider myself to be at an intermediate level with my understanding of Python, so I didn't
        
        hesitate to jump into the quiz to test my knowledge.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        The quiz allows us to have 10 attempts at 13 questions & we must get all the
        
        questions correct to pass the unit. On my first attempt I got 2 questions wrong! These were on the topics of <a href="../revision/python_data_structures.html">Python Data Structures</a> &

        <a href="../revision/python_tests.html">Python Tests</a> which admittedly I have not spent much time learning about, though it prompted me
        
        to spend the next 10 minutes obsessively researching to refresh my memory & then I was able to retry the quiz & get those 2 questions correct.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        I then spent Saturday afternoon further revising these topics by creating notes to store in my icloud drive which I then reviewed
        
        for the rest of the night as I was relaxing on the couch.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        I woke up this morning & decided to include a new <a href="../revision/revision.html">Revision</a>
        
        directory in the structure of my blog project where I can create & store detailed independent pages dedicated to explaining concepts
        
        which I feel I need to deepen & solidify my understanding of by applying the <a href="https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/">Feynman Technique</a>.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        This new <a href="../revision/revision.html">Revision</a> directory will serve as a great resource
        
        for me going forward & I'm excited to expand my learning experience by contributing to it each week.
    </p>

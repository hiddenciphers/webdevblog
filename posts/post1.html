    <h2>My 2024 Web Development Blog - Post 1</h2>
    <p><i>Published on: January 27, 2024</i></p>
    <p>This is my first blog post documenting my journey into web development...</p>
    <p>I just created this blog using ChatGPT, HTML, CSS & Javascript. I will be hosting it on my Github & deploying it to Vercel.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this blog is to solidify my knowledge as I'm learning by using the Feynman Technique which involves reiterating or
        explaining new concepts in a simplified way which will help me to gain a deeper and more thorough understanding of what I am
        learning throughout my web development journey in 2024.</p>
    <p>I will aim to update the blog atleast once a week.</p>

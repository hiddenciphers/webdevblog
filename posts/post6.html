    <p>I spent the week doing project assessments for each unit, then on friday I had some technical difficulties which led to me needing to buy
        a new monitor. I spent Saturday finalising 2 project assessments, File Transfer Protocol & Apply Introductory Programming Techniques,
        before completing 2 of the knowledge assessment quizes & submitting the projects.

        I would usually get up early on Sunday & compose a decent blog post but I have been swamped with life stuff & needed a sleep in.

       Today, I did however manage to get through the next unit of my Udemy course "CSS Grid". Most of the concepts I understand & can apply
       quite easily but there were a few things I found myself struggling with, therefore I would like to revisit the module this week
       when I get a chance & really try to solidify all the concepts.

        Once I fully understand all the concepts of CSS Grid, I will create a responsive page to demonstrate my knowledge & ability <a href="../revision/grid.html">here</a>

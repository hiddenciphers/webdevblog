            <h2>Performance Testing</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Performance testing assesses the efficiency of a piece of code or an entire application.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>It evaluates factors such as speed, responsiveness, & scalability.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>The size of the code being tested can range from a function to the entire application.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Performance testing helps identify bottlenecks, optimise code, & ensure the application meets
            
                        performance expectations under various conditions, such as heavy load or concurrent users.</li>

            <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unit testing focuses on the smallest parts of the software design, typically individual functions or modules.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>It checks if the actual results of these units match the expected results.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Unit tests can be conducted manually or automatically through testing frameworks.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Unit testing ensures that each component of the software functions correctly in isolation.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>It aids in early detection of bugs and facilitates code maintenance & refactoring.</li>

            <h2>End-To-End Testing</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>End-to-end testing involves testing the entire application, simulating real-world scenarios.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>The goal is to guarantee the stability of the application, ensuring that all components work together seamlessly.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>These tests should still pass with minimal effort when new code is added.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>End-to-end testing validates the flow of data & interactions between different modules of the application, helping to identify any integration issues.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>It provides a comprehensive view of the system's functionality.</li>

            <h2>Acceptance Testing</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Acceptance testing is the final phase of testing that assesses whether the application is ready for deployment.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>It checks the application against the client/business requirements to confirm that it meets their needs & is aligned with the specified criteria.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Acceptance testing provides assurance that the developed software satisfies the client's expectations & is ready for release.</li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>It is crucial for ensuring the overall quality & reliability of the application.</li>

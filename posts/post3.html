        This week I attended the Tafe Certificate IV in WebDev/Programming info & orientation session, everyone seemed nice & very excited to get started.
    </p>
    <p>
        I spent the second half of the week doing a free web design course on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann - <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/web-design-secrets">Web Design For Web Developers: Build Beautiful Websites!</a>
        
        This course was a basic introduction to some simple web design principles.
    </p>
    <p>
        I then moved on to begin <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp">The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp</a> by Dr. Angela Yu.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am really enjoying Dr. Yu's course & teaching style.
    </p>
    <p>    
        So far we have covered:
        <ul>
            <li>Introduction to HTML</li>
            <li>Intermediate HTML</li>
            <li>Multi-Page Websites</li>
            <li>Introduction to CSS</li>
            <li>CSS Properties</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the language Web Developers use to structure basic one-page & multi-page websites using HTML tags to contruct HTML elements

        which can then be styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which is an accompanying language used to target the HTML elements & style them with the use of CSS
        
        properties which consist of many options such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Color</li>
            <li>Background Color</li>
            <li>Font-Weight</li>
            <li>Font-Size</li>
            <li>Font-Family</li>
        </ul>
        Just to name a few...
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        Most importantly, I learnt about the "Box Model" which consists of 3 properties.
        <ol>
            <b><li><h3>Border</h3></li></b>
            <ul>
                <li>The 'border' property is used to define the border around an element.</li>
                <li>It consists of three sub-properties: 'border-width', 'border-style', & 'border-color'.</li>
            </ul>
            <b><li><h3>Margin</h3></li></b>
            <ul>
                <li>The 'margin' property controls the space outside an element's border.</li>
                <li>It can be set as a single value (applies to all sides) or as four values (for each side individually)</li>
                <li>Example: 'margin: 10px;' creates a 10-pixel margin on all sides.</li>
            </ul>
            <b><li><h3>Padding</h3></li></b>
            <ul>
                <li>The 'padding' property controls the space between an element's content & its border.</li>
                <li>Similar to margin, it can be set as a single value or as four values.</li>
                <li>Example: 'padding: 15px;' adds a 15-pixel padding to all sides.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        Understanding & effectively using these properties is crucial for Web Development, as they play a significant role in creating the layout & appearance of web pages.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will continue completing this Udemy course side by side with the Certificate IV Tafe course & document everything I have learnt each week from both courses here in this blog
        
        which will really help me to solidify my understanding of these concepts.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        Tomorrow is my first official day of Tafe, it is a combined class with the Programming students where we will be covering the topics:
        <ul>
            <li>Apply advanced critical thinking to work processes</li>
            <li>Identify & evaluate emerging technologies & practices</li>
            <li>Identify & resolve client ICT problems</li>
        </ul>
        Monday's classes run from 9:00 - 12:00 then I plan on spending the afternoon doing some revision & making some more progress on the Udemy course. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I really enjoy learning Web Development & I'm excited to get started!

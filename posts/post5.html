        This week is a bit of a blur after an onslaught of information coming from all
        directions in the Tafe classes.

        I made a start on my Python project by recording 3 questions in a roleplay scenario
        with my mock company's senior developer. I then created a flowchart & wrote some pseudocode
        for a component of the program I will be developing in the next stage of the project.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        My questions were not quite 1 minute long each but I'm pretty confident I hit all the correct points,
        so hopefully I did ok.

        I also made some progress on my FTP (File Transfer Protocol) project while messing around with Filezilla
        for afew hours after Wednesday's class where Shanna gave us a thorough walkthrough of all features & functions
        associated with an FTP client. I'm looking forward to learning more on the topic of FTP security this week.

        I have begun attempting the first assessment quiz for my Web Dev class with Steve & although I have completed
        2 of the 6 workbooks for the class I quickly ran into some questions which have not been covered in the workbooks
        or the classes...so far. I will revisit this assessment after Tuesday's class with Steve this week.

    <h2>Udemy Course - CSS Flexbox</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>
        I spent most of the weekend catching up on my Udemy course. Picking up from where I left off.
        The last module I completed was "Advanced CSS" where I learnt about CSS properties in regards
        to responsive design such as, display:, float: & @media queries.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        I just completed the "CSS Flexbox" module where I learnt about the flex & flex-inline values
        of the display:, flex-direction:, justify-content:, flex-wrap:, align-items: & align-content:
        properties. 
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        I was introduced to the <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy</a> game which I loved!
        It was super fun to learn about Flexbox layout using this awesome site.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        I then learnt about Flex Sizing (shrinking & growing) by using the properties:
        <ul class="post5-list-items">
            <li>flex-basis:</li>
            <p>Determines the width of flex items in row or height of flex items in column</p>
            <br/>
            <li>min-width:</li>
            <p>Determines the minimum size the flex items can shrink to</p>
            <br/>
            <li>max-width:</li>
            <p>Determines the maximum size the flex itms can grow to</p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                <strong>When min-width is larger than flex-basis, the flex-basis is ignored
                    & min-width is applied.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <li>flex-grow: 1;</li>
            <p>Turning on flex-grow: allows items to grow past the flex-basis: to take up the full row evenly</p>
            <br/>
            <li>flex-shrink: 1;</li>
            <p>Turning on flex-shrink: sets items to size of flex-basis: by default. The flex items will
                not grow but shrink until it reaches min-width:. If min-width: is not set the flex items
                will shrink to the minimum width of the content.
            </p>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        I am experimenting with making a responsive page using CSS Flexbox <a href="../revision/flexbox.html">here</a>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
        I have made some changes to the overall styling of the blog which I am happy with for now, but I would like to
        edit the <a href="../revision/revise.html">Revision</a> pages to follow the same theme as the main blog page, using the main header, footer & darkmode
        toggle switch feature, which ideally will work on all pages across the blog instead of just the main page. I
        suspect I will need to delve deeper into JavaScript to make that happen...baby steps.
